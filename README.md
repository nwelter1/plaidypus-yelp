# Yelp API Challenge

## Overview

Create a two-page application using the Yelp Fusion API.

1. On the first page, you should be able to search for businesses in Evanston (or any given city if you would like a challenge).
2. When you select a result, it should take you to a second page where you can see details about the business.

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to give you a chance to show a business your ability to code. They'll be looking at how you handle making requests to an API, as well as how you handle the JSON responses. They'll also be looking for basic understanding of React components, and for proficiency in javascript or typescript if preferred (usage of ES6 features is encouraged).

## Setup Instructions

1. Create an account with yelp [here](https://www.yelp.com/signup)
2. [Follow the instructions here to get started with the Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started)
3. Documentation on API usage can be found [here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3). For your application, you will be using the `Search API` and the `Business API`.

## Requirements

* Commit your code to a public repository (using github, bitbucket, or whatever service you prefer).
